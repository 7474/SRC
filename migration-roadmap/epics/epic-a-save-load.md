# Epic A: Save/Load System

**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: 1-2  
**Estimated Effort**: 5-7 days  
**Risk Level**: Critical (Security)

## Overview

The Save/Load system requires critical security improvements and feature completion to ensure safe file operations and reliable data persistence.

## Issues & Tasks

### A.1: Path Normalization and Security Validation
**Priority**: Critical  
**Effort**: 3 days  
**Sprint**: 1

#### Problem Statement
Current save/load operations lack proper path validation, creating potential security vulnerabilities through path traversal attacks.

#### Technical Requirements
- Implement path normalization for all file operations
- Add security validation to prevent directory traversal
- Validate file extensions and content types
- Add proper error handling for invalid paths

#### Files Affected
- `SRCCore/SRC.cs` (Primary)
- `SRCCore/IO/FileOperations.cs`
- `SRCCore/Security/PathValidator.cs` (New)

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All file paths properly normalized before use
- [ ] Path traversal attempts blocked and logged
- [ ] File extension validation implemented
- [ ] Security tests passing
- [ ] Backwards compatibility maintained

#### Testing Requirements
- Security penetration testing
- Path traversal attack simulation
- Cross-platform path handling validation
- Performance impact assessment

### A.2: Quick Save Feature Completion
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 2 days  
**Sprint**: 2

#### Problem Statement
Quick save functionality is partially implemented with TODO comments indicating incomplete features.

#### Technical Requirements
- Complete quick save implementation
- Add quick load functionality
- Implement auto-save configuration
- Add save slot management

#### Files Affected
- `SRCCore/SRC.cs`
- `SRCCore/Configuration/SaveConfig.cs`
- `SRCCore/UI/SaveLoadUI.cs`

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Quick save creates valid save files
- [ ] Quick load restores game state correctly
- [ ] Auto-save configurable and functional
- [ ] Save slot management working
- [ ] UI integration complete

#### Testing Requirements
- Quick save/load cycle testing
- Auto-save timing validation
- Save file integrity verification
- UI workflow testing

### A.3: Save File Format Validation
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 2 days  
**Sprint**: 2

#### Problem Statement
Save file format validation needs improvement to handle corrupted or incompatible files gracefully.

#### Technical Requirements
- Enhanced save file format validation
- Version compatibility checking
- Corrupted file recovery options
- Migration tools for old formats

#### Files Affected
- `SRCCore/IO/SaveFileValidator.cs` (New)
- `SRCCore/Migration/SaveMigrator.cs` (New)
- `SRCCore/SRC.cs`

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Save file format validation implemented
- [ ] Version compatibility checking working
- [ ] Corrupted file handling graceful
- [ ] Migration tools functional
- [ ] Error reporting comprehensive

#### Testing Requirements
- Corrupted file handling tests
- Version migration testing
- Performance impact measurement
- User experience validation
