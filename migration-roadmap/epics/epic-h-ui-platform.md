## Technical Implementation Details

### Platform UI Abstraction
```csharp
public interface IPlatformUI
{
    void ShowDialog(IDialog dialog);
    void ShowNotification(string message, NotificationType type);
    IFileDialog CreateFileDialog(FileDialogType type);
    void ApplyTheme(ITheme theme);
    bool SupportsFeature(UIFeature feature);
}
```

### Cross-Platform Implementation Strategy
```
Windows Platform:
- WinForms/WPF native integration
- Windows-specific dialogs and notifications
- Registry-based theme storage

Linux Platform:
- GTK+ integration via .NET bindings
