## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: MockGUI Completion (Sprint 3)
1. Audit all NotImplementedException instances
2. Implement missing MockGUI methods systematically
3. Validate mock behavior against real components

### Phase 2: Framework Enhancement (Sprint 3)
1. Enhance integration testing framework
2. Add cross-component testing capabilities
3. Implement test data management

### Phase 3: Coverage Improvement (Sprint 4)
1. Analyze current test coverage
2. Add tests for critical uncovered areas
3. Implement coverage monitoring

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- UI testing frameworks
- Code coverage tools
- Test data management systems
- Performance testing tools

### Internal Dependencies
- All core components (for testing)
- UI components (Epic H)
- Configuration system (Epic D)
- System libraries (Epic E)

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risks
- **Mock Complexity**: UI mocks might not accurately represent real behavior
- **Test Maintenance**: Large number of tests to maintain
- **Performance Impact**: Comprehensive testing could slow development

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular validation of mocks against real components
- Automated test maintenance tools
- Parallel test execution for performance
- Selective test execution during development

## Technical Implementation Details

### MockGUI Architecture
```csharp
public interface IMockGUIComponent
{
    void SimulateEvent(UIEvent eventType, object eventData);
    T GetProperty<T>(string propertyName);
    void SetProperty<T>(string propertyName, T value);
    bool IsVisible { get; }
    bool IsEnabled { get; }
}
```

### NotImplementedException Resolution Plan
```
Phase 1: Core UI Components (2 days)
- Button, TextBox, ComboBox mocks
- Basic event simulation
- Property access

Phase 2: Complex Components (2 days)  
- Grid, TreeView, Custom controls
- Advanced event handling
- State management

Phase 3: Integration Components (2 days)
- Dialog mocks
- Menu system mocks
- Toolbar and status bar mocks
```

### Integration Testing Framework
```csharp
public abstract class IntegrationTestBase
{
    protected ITestContainer Container { get; }
    protected ITestDataManager TestData { get; }
    protected IMockGUIProvider GUI { get; }
    
    public virtual void SetUp();
    public virtual void TearDown();
    protected void AssertUIState(params UIAssertion[] assertions);
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### MockGUI Validation
```
1. Mock Behavior Tests: Verify mocks behave like real components
2. Event Simulation Tests: Validate event handling accuracy
3. State Management Tests: Ensure mock state consistency
4. Performance Tests: Mock overhead measurement
```

### Integration Testing
```
1. Cross-Component Tests: Multi-component interaction validation
2. End-to-End Tests: Complete workflow testing
3. Data Flow Tests: Data consistency across components
4. Error Handling Tests: Exception and error scenarios
```

### Coverage Analysis
```
1. Current Coverage Assessment: Baseline measurement
2. Gap Analysis: Identify untested code paths
3. Priority Testing: Focus on critical functionality
4. Continuous Monitoring: Ongoing coverage tracking
```
