# SRC# Migration Roadmap

## Executive Summary

The SRC# (Simulation RPG Construction Sharp) C# .NET migration is a comprehensive modernization effort to convert the legacy VB.NET codebase to C# while maintaining full compatibility and improving performance, security, and maintainability.

### Current State Analysis

- **310 TODO comments** requiring implementation across core functionality
- **141 NotImplementedException instances** (primarily in test infrastructure)
- **Extensive legacy VB.NET conversion artifacts** with thousands of commented lines
- **Core functionality mostly complete** but requiring refinement and bug fixes

### Migration Strategy

The migration follows a **8-Epic, 26-Issue structure** organized by functional areas and prioritized by impact on core gameplay functionality.

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Critical Functionality (Sprints 1-2)
**Epics A-C**: Core game systems that directly impact gameplay
- Save/Load system security and reliability
- Game command logic and AI behavior
- Expression system and string handling

### Phase 2: Infrastructure (Sprint 3)
**Epics D-F**: Supporting systems and quality infrastructure
- Configuration management modernization
- System libraries and utilities
- Test infrastructure completion

### Phase 3: Quality & Maintenance (Sprint 4+)
**Epics G-H**: Code quality and platform optimization
- Legacy code cleanup
- Cross-platform UI features

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Save/Load Security**: Path traversal vulnerabilities
2. **AI Weapon Selection**: Critical gameplay bug affecting balance
3. **String Functions**: Core expression system dependencies

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive testing before each release
- Backwards compatibility validation
- Security review for file system operations
- Performance benchmarking for core systems

## Success Criteria

### Technical Objectives
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] 100% backwards compatibility with existing save files
- [ ] All core gameplay features functional
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)

### Quality Objectives  
- [ ] All TODO comments resolved
- [ ] All NotImplementedException instances addressed
- [ ] Legacy VB.NET artifacts removed
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified

## Timeline & Resources

### Estimated Effort
- **Sprint 1**: 2-3 weeks (Critical fixes)
- **Sprint 2**: 2-3 weeks (Core completion)
- **Sprint 3**: 3-4 weeks (Infrastructure)
- **Sprint 4+**: Ongoing (Quality improvements)

### Dependencies
- .NET 8 SDK availability
- Security review tooling
- Cross-platform testing infrastructure
- Community feedback integration

## Communication Plan

### Progress Tracking
- Weekly epic status updates
- Sprint retrospectives
- Community milestone announcements
- GitHub issue and PR management

### Stakeholder Engagement
- Developer documentation updates
- Community testing coordination
- Performance impact communication
- Migration assistance for existing projects
